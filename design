Need some kind of design for better managment of entities


ECS?

Unity like component system?


---------
Entity:
  struct Entity{
    //For easier lookup of entities
    pub id : u64,   
    //List of component traits
    components : Vec<Box<impl Component>>
  }

  pub trait Component {
    //to be able to get component by name
    fn name() -> &str,
    //Updates every frame
    fn update(),
    //Post creation initialization function, called after the component is pushed
    fn awake()
    //Called when either the component is removed or the entity is
    fn death()
  }
