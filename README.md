# renderer
A realtime renderer writen in Rust using wgpu, plus all supporting infrastructure, including a math library, and model and image loading 

My current streaming project, all code is writen live on my [twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/ciubix8513), VODs are available on my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@ciubix8513)

## Goals for this project
#### Stage 1: Rendering basic emotes
- [x] Basic colored rendering
