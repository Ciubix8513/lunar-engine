# lunar-engine 
A game engine written in Rust using wgpu, includes a math library, a renderer, an ECS(like) and various file format asset loading

My current streaming project, a lot of the code is writen live on my [twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/ciubix8513), VODs are available on my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@ciubix8513)

## Goals for this project
#### Stage 1: Renderer
- [x] Basic colored rendering
- [x] Wavefront obj loading
- [x] .bmp loading
- [x] textured rendering
#### Stage 2: Game engine? idk why not 
- [x] Rendering abstraction
- [x] Ecs, or at least ecs like
- [x] png format loading
- [x] Better input
- [ ] OPTIMIZATION
- [ ] PBR rendering 
- [ ] post proccessing stuff
- [ ] A physics engine?
- [ ] gltf loading
- [ ] Skeletal animations


Note: This is just my personal project, some of these goals may never get accomplished or be rearranged, no guarantees.
